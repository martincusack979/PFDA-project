### Analysing a data set on world population growth

#### Introduction

On 2022, India surpassed China as the most populous country on our planet.  I have always been interested in teh phenomenon of population growths (as well as fluctuating 
fertility rates within individual countries) and this seems particularly relevant at the present moment, when there is so much anxiety about the damage which man-made processes are wreaking on our environment and the resulting effect on climate change.  Does the inevitable ramping up of consumption and use of natural resources population growth present a similar threat to our environment as that of industrial pollution and the burning of fossil fuels?
NOTE: the dataset which I chose to work ononly has data up to the earlt pasrt of 2022 and so displays China as the world's most populous nation.  As noted above, thsi situation has now changed and India, with )))))))), now has the world's largest population


### Checking for null values
There are no null values in this data set.


### How to drop columns:

### Data visualisation:

I used the plotting function in the Matplotlib package to gain a perspective on some key aspects of the information in my chosen data set. Firstly, I created a simple bar chart of the six most populous countries in the world, with country names on the x-axis and populations expressed in terms of billions on the y-axis. The main insight to take from teh resulting visualistaion is that the populations of China and India far outstrip all other countries of the world, being three times greater than the third largest country in population, the United States. Since the fourth and fifth most populius countruies are Pakistan and Indonesia, this shows us that the vast majority of the world's population is concentrated in the continent of Asia.

I then used the same plotting fucntion to explore and visualise data
