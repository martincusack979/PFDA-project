### Analysing a data set on world population growth

#### Introduction



I sourced a dataset on world population growth from the popular data science website Kaggle. Link below:

### Checking for null values
There are no null values in this data set.


### How to drop columns:

### Data visualisation:

I used the plotting function in the Matplotlib package to gain a perspective on some key aspects of the information in my chosen data set. Firstly, I created a simple bar chart of the six most populous countries in the world, with country names on the x-axis and populations expressed in terms of billions on the y-axis. The main insight to take from teh resulting visualistaion is that the populations of China and India far outstrip all other countries of the world, being three times greater than the third largest country in population, the United States. Since the fourth and fifth most populius countruies are Pakistan and Indonesia, this shows us that the vast majority of the world's population is concentrated in the continent of Asia.

I then used the same plotting fucntion to explore and visualise data
