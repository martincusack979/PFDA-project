### Analysing a data set on world population growth

#### Introduction

On July 11 2022, the Reuters news organisations reported that a just-published United Nations study revealed that in 2023 India would surpass China as the most populous country on our planet.  I have always been interested in the phenomenon of population growths (as well as fluctuating fertility rates within individual countries) and what this tells us about the future of our societies and teh effect on our economies as well as the natural environment. The subject of population growth seems particularly relevant at the present moment, when there is so much anxiety about the damage which man-made processes are wreaking on our environment and the resulting effect on climate change.  Does the inevitable increase in consumption of natural resources brought about by population growth present an equal threat to our environment as that of industrial pollution and the burning of fossil fuels? I hoped to explore a datset with figures on population growth over recent decadees in odrder to tale a closer look at this phenomenon and see what inisghts could be gleaned

I sourced a dataset on world population growth from the popular data science website Kaggle. Link below:

### Checking for null values
There are no null values in this data set.


### How to drop columns:

### Data visualisation:

I used the plotting function in the Matplotlib package to gain a perspective on some key aspects of the information in my chosen data set. Firstly, I created a simple bar chart of the six most populous countries in the world, with country names on the x-axis and populations expressed in terms of billions on the y-axis. The main insight to take from teh resulting visualistaion is that the populations of China and India far outstrip all other countries of the world, being three times greater than the third largest country in population, the United States. Since the fourth and fifth most populius countruies are Pakistan and Indonesia, this shows us that the vast majority of the world's population is concentrated in the continent of Asia.

I then used the same plotting fucntion to explore and visualise data
